# Cloud Data Lake Implementation and Optimization

Welcome to the Cloud Data Lake Implementation and Optimization project! In this engaging and slightly adventurous task, you'll step into the shoes of a Mid Data Engineer at Cloudfide. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to optimize data ingestion, processing, and analysis using Databricks and modern cloud services, preferably Azure. This project is designed to test your skills in creating data models, setting up ETL/ELT processes, and ensuring data quality and integrity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Azure account
- Databricks workspace

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cloud-data-lake-implementation
   ```

### Running the Project
- Open your Databricks workspace.
- Import the provided notebooks.
- Follow the instructions in each notebook to complete the tasks.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains Databricks notebooks for implementing the data model.
- `data/`: Mock data sources for testing.

## Tasks
1. **Design and Implement a Data Model**
   - Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a proposed data lake model.
   - Implement this model in a Databricks notebook using Azure services.

## Notes
- Ensure the model supports analytical queries and adheres to data integrity principles.

Let's dive into the cloud and make some data magic happen!
